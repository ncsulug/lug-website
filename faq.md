Meetings
--------
The LUG meets every week during the Spring and Fall semesters. Each week, we alternate
between our Technical Sessions and Social Dinners.

Technical sessions are generally held in the same room over the course of the semester.
Any room changes will be sent out on the mailing list.
Venues for social dinners are decided upon the week prior to the meeting, and then sent
out on the mailing list.

The LUG usually has its weekly meetings from 7 to 8.30 PM on Tuesday nights. We normally
like to have the talk before going out to a restaurant for dinner (so that we can keep
talking), but are willing to order something to eat in the meeting room if time is precious
for the speaker.

Guest Speakers
--------------
The LUG is a close-knit community of hackers and makers who like to get together on a
weekly basis to geek out over technology and creativity. We welcome guest speakers who
share in this passion to come and speak with us, not to us.

Topics the LUG is interested include:

* programming
* computer software
* computer hardware
* computer ethics
* [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)
* free & open source movements
* and similar!


Parking
-------
We try to have our meetings on NC State's Centennial Campus. Parking at NC State is free
after 5 PM in most places (be sure to check the signs). When parking on Centennial, the best
place to get a spot is in the CC decks on Partners Way. There are four decks on Partners:
two CC, one Public pay parking, and one private corporate deck.

Attendance
----------
Typical attendance ranges from 8 to 12 people, though we can advertise to more groups to
get up to 20.

Mailing List
------------
We have a
[mailing list](http://lists.ncsu.edu/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?user=&passw=&func=info&list=lug)
hosted on NC State's instance of Majordomo. Official updates and
announcements are sent out on the mailing list, so if you want to keep up with what the LUG
is doing, it's pretty essential to sign yourself up.
If you want to unsubscribe, you can do so
[here](http://lists.ncsu.edu/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?user=&passw=&func=show).

IRC
---
Internet Relay Chat is the primary medium of communication for the LUG. IRC is a real-time
chatting protocol that dates back to 1988 and is still the technology of choice among free
and open source developers. Our channel is hosted on Freenode and usually has a few dozen
people in the room at any given time.

~~~
Server: chat.freenode.net
Port: 6667 | 6697 (SSL)
Channel: #ncsulug
~~~

If you don't have an IRC client, you can visit us by using the
[Freenode web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ncsulug).

Please note that the IRC channel is a public forum and not all of the visitors in the
channel are LUG members or students at NC State University.

**ZNC Bouncer**

If you really want to get the most out of IRC, a bouncer allows you to keep a connection
alive in your channels 24/7 so that you never miss a beat when you're offline. We run a
bouncer (ZNC) on the LUG Server, Short. **It is a members-only service.** If you're a member
and would like access to ZNC, speak with **spiffytech** or **albatron** on IRC.
