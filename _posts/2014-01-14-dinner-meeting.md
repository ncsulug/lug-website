New year, new semester!

Our first social dinner of the semester will be at Mitch's Tavern. Dinner doesn't really
have a specific topic, besides "stuff that we think is cool/has been happening recently/
over the holidays."

When: Tuesday, January 14, 7:00 PM

Where: Mitch's Tavern, 2426 Hillsborough Street

For newcomers, keep in mind that the LUG does not pay for dinner - everyone pays for what
they order. (Mitch's prices are reasonable, though .) But if the restaurant isn't busy,
they shouldn't mind if you just hang out with us and maybe have a beverage.
