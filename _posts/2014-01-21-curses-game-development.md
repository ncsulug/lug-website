Hey everyone!

We'll have a talk by Barry Peddycord III on Tuesday, January 21 on his game development
with Curses/streaming workflow. Here is his description:

"I'm going to talk about the new software powering my blog that allows me to stream my
terminal directly to my website! I use a Rube-Goldberg-esque combination of open source
software, virtual private servers, and the one true Emacs to livestream and record my
roguelike game development! I can get as technical as you like, so bring lots of questions!"

When: January 21, 2014, 7pm

Where: EB 2, 3001 (on the bridge between the two wings)

Wow, much talk, such topic! Hope to see you all there!
