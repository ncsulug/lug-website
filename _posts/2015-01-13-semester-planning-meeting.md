Welcome back from break! This Tuesday, we'll have our traditional first-week-of-the-semester
planning meeting, where we'll introduce ourselves and plan out what technical topics we're
going to discuss. We'll also be discussing:

* What to do at FOSS Fair
* When to have hack days
* What to do with our servers (we have a new one!)
* Where to eat dinner

When: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 7:00 PM

Where: Engineering Building II, room 3001

3001 is on the bridge that connects the two halves of EB II - find a stairwell, go all the way up to the 3rd floor, and then walk towards the center.

See you at the meeting!
