title:  Hack Days, Web Domains and Other Fall Plans

As the fall semester gets rolling, the LUG has quite a lot to look forward to!
For those who may have missed the past few meetings, here's a quick recap of
what we're looking forward to:

Diversified Schedule
--------------------

We want to have more interactive activities this semester, so we're trying out a
slightly modified monthly-rotating schedule:

1. **Tech Talk**: The first Tuesday of each month will kick off with an
   entertaining and educational discussion of some open-source or technical
   topic, from booting up Linux machines in style to version control systems to
   popular software alternatives with nontraditional licensing.
2. **Hack Day**: Put your skills to the test as we host interactive tutorials
   and challenges, accomplishing everything from remotely upgrading a server to
   web design on an open-source software stack to showing off our personal side
   projects.
3. **Tech Talk**: The third Tuesday will typically be another tech talk; along
   with in-house presentations, we may also have representatives from NCSU
   faculty and other companies come in and speak, offering networking
   possibilities.
4. **Social Dinner**: After a long month staring at screens, we'll take the
   final Tuesday off and go enjoy a good meal at one of Raleigh's popular dining
   locations. We may talk tech, or we may not, but we'll always be enjoying
   great cuisine.

Servers and Websites
--------------------

The LUG currently has access to two servers physically located in EBII on NCSU's
Centennial Campus. Along with our main website domain (right here,
http://lug.ncsu.edu), we also have access to http://opensource.ncsu.edu. At
least one of our hack days this fall (maybe more!) will be devoted to server
configuration and website design, so come to our next few meetings with any
ideas or skills you wish to bring to the table!

Also, if you would like to have remote access to either `char` or `short` (the
names we affectionately give our two servers), feel free to contact our
president [Quentin](mailto:qlyoung@ncsu.edu).

September 6th
-------------

Last but certainly not least, we will next meet on **Tuesday, September 6th**,
[same time, same place](/faq)! This week will likely be a hack day as we get
started preparing our servers for fall web development projects.

Next week, on Wednesday, September 14th, we may or may not have a very special
guest visiting our club--more info will be at this Tuesday's meeting, so check
back for details!
