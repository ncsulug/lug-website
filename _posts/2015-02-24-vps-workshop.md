In our next meeting, Barry Peddycord III (isharacomix) will hold a workshop on getting a
virtual private server running on Digital Ocean. After creating the server, you'll learn
how to do fun Linux stuff like setting up a reverse proxy for hosting a personal wiki,
setting up a personal IRC bouncer using ZNC, hosting your own private Git repositories, and
other topics as requested by the audience.

Where: Engineering Building II, room 1227

When: Tuesday, February 24, 2015, 7:00 PM
