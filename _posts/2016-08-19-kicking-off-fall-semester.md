Welcome back, LUG members! Whether you're starting another semester as a student
here on campus, taking a semester off for an internship or research, or even
settling in to a post-degree career, we're glad to welcome you back to campus
for our fall semester events.

As a reminder, our first meeting of the semester will occur **next Tuesday,
August 23rd, at 7:00pm in EBII Room 3001**. The agenda consists of introductions
of the club itself and its members, as well as discussing topics of interest for
the semester's meetings.

For more information about times, locations, and topics, I highly recommend
heading over to the [FAQ](/faq/) and taking a look!

As of the time of posting, food will not be provided at this initial meeting;
however, rest assured that the LUG typically enjoys a good evening meal.

As usual, for any questions, comments, or concerns, head over to the mailing
list or IRC channel and hit us up!
