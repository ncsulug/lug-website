Greetings LUG and friends of LUG! We are pleased to announce that on Wednesday,
September 14th we will be hosting members of Facebook's Production Engineering
team for live technical challenges of an unspecified nature. Attendees who want
to participate should bring their (preferably Linux) laptops and a competetive
spirit. You can also expect free food :-)

This event will take place in our normal meeting space (Engineering Building 2,
Room 3001) beginning at 7:00 P.M. EST and continue to approximately 8:30 P.M.

This event replaces our regularly scheduled Tuesday meeting on 9/13.
