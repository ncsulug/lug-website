Greetings LUG and friends of LUG! We are pleased to announce that on Wednesday,
September 14th we will be hosting representatives of Facebook's Production
Engineering team. Team members will be delivering live technical challenges of
an unspecified nature, so attendees who want to participate should bring their
(preferably Linux) laptops and a competetive spirit. You can also expect free
food :-)

This event will take place in our normal meeting space (Engineering Building 2,
Room 3001) beginning at 7:00 P.M. EST and continue to approximately 8:30 P.M.

This event replaces our regularly scheduled Tuesday meeting on 9/13.
