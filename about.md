The LUG is a student group dedicated to the maker culture of creativity and doing cool things with technology.
While our name is officially the Linux Users Group, our group is more like a general technology enthusiasts club.
We enjoy the company of anyone who likes to tinker with technology, learn how it works, and force it to do their
bidding.
</p>

<p>
Given the nature of the LUG, our membership mostly consists of software developers and students from the NC State
Computer Science Department, but we don't turn anyone away who is genuinely interested in learning more about
technology- there are no dues, and you don't have to be a student to join.
</p>

<p>
Unlike other Student Groups in the Computer Science Department that focus on service or leadership, our meetings
are generally "show-and-tell" sessions where we give a technical demonstration on something that we've done or
learned about recently. We also meet more often than most other groups, as we get together physically every week
and interact on our mailing list and IRC channel whenever we aren't together in person.
</p>

<p>
We also host Hack Days about twice each semester. A Hack Day is like an open-ended workshop where everyone brings
whatever they're working on to a room in order to work on them together. They serve as a great way to get feedback
on early prototypes of personal projects.
</p>

<p>
The LUG is a close-knit group of technology-loving folks who stay together because of our community. We would love
to have you join us - just attend one of our meetings or other events and we'll welcome you with open arms.
