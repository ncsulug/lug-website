<p>
The Linux Users' Group at NC State is a student group dedicated to maker culture and serving the free & open source software community. Founded in Fall of 1994, we are one of the oldest LUGs still in existence. While we have Linux in the name, our group is more like a general technology enthusiasts club. We enjoy the company of anyone who likes to tinker with technology, learn how it works, and force it to do their bidding.

<p>
Given the nature of the LUG, our membership mostly consists of software developers and students from the NC State
Computer Science Department, but we don't turn anyone away who is genuinely interested in learning more about
technology - there are no dues, and you don't have to be a student to join.
</p>

<p>
Unlike other Student Groups in the Computer Science Department that focus on service or leadership, our meetings
are generally "show-and-tell" sessions where we give a technical demonstration on something that we've done or
learned about recently. We also meet more often than most other groups; we meet IRL every week
and maintain a mailing list and IRC channel on Freenode.
</p>

<p>
The LUG is a close-knit group of technology-loving folks who stay together because of our community. We would love
to have you join us - just attend one of our meetings or other events and we'll welcome you with open arms.
